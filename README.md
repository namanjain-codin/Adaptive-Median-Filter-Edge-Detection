# Adaptive-Median-Filter-Edge-Detection
This project demonstrates key digital image processing techniques including adding salt & pepper noise, removing noise with an adaptive median filter, detecting edges using Canny Edge Detection, and applying Otsu’s Thresholding for image segmentation — all implemented in Python using OpenCV and NumPy in Google Colab.
## Project Overview
Goal: Apply fundamental digital image processing techniques to improve image quality and extract meaningful features.

Techniques Covered:

Convert RGB images to grayscale.

Add salt & pepper noise (simulate 30% corruption).

Remove noise using an adaptive median filter.

Detect edges using the Canny algorithm.

Segment the image using Otsu’s automatic thresholding.

Visualize and save all intermediate results.

## Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab

## How It Works
1️⃣ Load Image: Import an image from Google Drive.
2️⃣ Convert to Grayscale: Simplify the image for processing.
3️⃣ Add Noise: Simulate salt & pepper noise (30% probability).
4️⃣ Denoise: Apply an adaptive median filter to remove noise.
5️⃣ Edge Detection: Use Canny Edge Detection to find edges.
6️⃣ Segmentation: Perform Otsu’s Thresholding for binarization.
7️⃣ Save & Visualize: Save processed images and display results using Matplotlib.
