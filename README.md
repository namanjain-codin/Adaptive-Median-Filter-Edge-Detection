# Adaptive-Median-Filter-Edge-Detection
This project demonstrates key digital image processing techniques including adding salt & pepper noise, removing noise with an adaptive median filter, detecting edges using Canny Edge Detection, and applying Otsu’s Thresholding for image segmentation — all implemented in Python using OpenCV and NumPy in Google Colab.
## Project Overview
Goal: Apply fundamental digital image processing techniques to improve image quality and extract meaningful features.

Techniques Covered:

Convert RGB images to grayscale.

Add salt & pepper noise (simulate 30% corruption).

Remove noise using an adaptive median filter.

Detect edges using the Canny algorithm.

Segment the image using Otsu’s automatic thresholding.

Visualize and save all intermediate results.
